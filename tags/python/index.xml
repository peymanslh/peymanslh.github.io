But besides these four, Python has other data structures that each of them like those four has some strengths and weaknesses based on their implementation and structure that we can use, and it&amp;rsquo;s better to know them because sometimes it might help and have a better performance and features based on your problem than &lt;code>list&lt;/code>, &lt;code>tuple&lt;/code>, &lt;code>set&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>dict&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
