## Me

My name is Peyman Salehi. I’m a software engineer.  
Most of my experiences are in back-end development. Besides that, I’m very enthusiastic about system engineering and spend my free time researching and learn more about it.  
In my blog, I mostly write about what I learn or experience in my job and usually relates to software engineering, programming languages, Linux, open-source software and, tools I use.  
And finally, I’m working in tech to make things easier for ourselves, not doing weird stuff!
