My name is Peyman Salehi. I'm a software engineer.   
Most of my experiences are in back-end development. 
Besides that, I'm very enthusiastic about system engineering and 
spend my free time researching and learning more about it.  
In my blog, I mostly write about what I learn or experience in my job, 
and it's usually related to software engineering, programming languages, 
Linux, open-source software, and tools I use.  
And finally, I'm working in tech to make things easier for ourselves, 
not doing weird stuff!
