description: Iâ€™m Peyman Salehi, a software engineer

My name is Peyman, I'm a software engineer, and this is my blog.  
I write here about what I learned or experienced. I also shrink my thoughts into ~~140~~ 280 characters on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_peymanslh), share some code I write on [GitHub](https://github.com/peymanslh), and photos I shoot on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/peyman.slh).
