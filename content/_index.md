I’m Peyman Salehi, a software engineer who uses spaces and Vim.  
This is my blog, and I write here about what I learn or experience. I also shrink my thoughts into ~~140~~ 280 characters on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_peymanslh), share some code I write on [GitHub](https://github.com/peymanslh), and photos I shoot on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/peyman.slh).
