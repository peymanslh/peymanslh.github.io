---

It's 2025 and with the rise of AI most people use AI tools to review news or tech
updates or get short summaries, but I still like to follow blogs from people that
I like their writing or tech companies that share their experience in their tech blog.  
To keep track of all of these posts, I finally found some tools that help me with
this process and have been perfect for me over the last few years.

## [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)
Feedly is a feed reader that I use to read the feeds of blogs and newsletters.
In my Feedly account, I have two categories, The first is blogs, in which I added
lots of blogs from different people that I like to follow or some company's engineering blogs.  
The second category is the feed of newsletters that I follow, and I added their feed there so
that I could follow them in Feedly instead of receiving emails in my inbox every week.  
Every weekend I'll try to review my Feedly list and add the posts I like to read to my Instapaper.  
It takes around 15-20 minutes to filter posts that the titles are interesting to me and add
them to Instapaper for reading them later.  
__Tip:__ Don't add any news websites to your Feedly feed, they post a lot of articles
daily and can spam your feed.

## [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com/)
I like Instapaper because of its simplicity and features like sending unread articles to Kindle.
I usually send unread posts in my Instapaper account to my Kindle(Instapaper merges multiple
posts in a single PDF file), or use its mobile app to read posts when I don't have access to my
Kindle.  
After reading each article, I can tag and archive the ones that I like and delete other ones.

## [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
Obsidian is a great tool for note-taking and writing with a great offline experience and a
cool desktop app(with VIM mode support), I'm new to Obsidian but I found that it has plugins
for Instapaper and Kindle that I can sync my notes on articles and books with Obsidian, which is great!
