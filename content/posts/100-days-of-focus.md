description: I started a 100-day challenge to force myself to stay away from distractions, and earn focus.
---

Lately, I've been reflecting on my daily routine and how it's negatively impacting my work and personal life. Spending most of my non-work hours watching shows, movies, and playing games leaves little time for reading, learning, and socializing with loved ones. Additionally, these distractions make it difficult to focus on work and personal growth. To address this issue, I've decided to start a 100-day challenge with specific guidelines to establish positive habits and prioritize my goals during my free time.

## Can‚Äôt Do
- Play games(except for chess)
- Watch shows and movies
- Spend more than 30 minutes on social media like Twitter(x), Instagram, LinkedIn(Crawl timelines and read shitty posts, not work-related), ‚Ä¶

## Can Do
- Watch video courses
- Read technical books
- Read novels and non-technical books
- Learn(programming related or anything)
- Watch 1 movie in a week(If it‚Äôs too damn good)
- Anything in the ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do‚Äù section that related to the work
- Go to the gym and do running

## My plan
I want to do these in my free time.
- Read 3 technical book
- Learn Java and Spring framework
- Read 1 article per day
- Get deep in Kubernetes and learn about its API
- Watch technical courses instead of shows and movies
- Learn more about OWASP and security
- Write blog posts about what I learn.
