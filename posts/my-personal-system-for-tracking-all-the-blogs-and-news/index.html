updates or get short summaries, but I still like to follow blogs from people that
I like their writing or tech companies that share their experience in their tech blog.<br>To keep track of all of these posts, I finally found some tools that help me with
this process and have been perfect for me over the last few years.</p><h2 id=feedly><a href=https://feedly.com/>Feedly</a></h2><p>Feedly is a feed reader that I use to read the feeds of blogs and newsletters.
In my Feedly account, I have two categories, The first is blogs, in which I added
lots of blogs from different people that I like to follow or some company&rsquo;s engineering blogs.<br>The second category is the feed of newsletters that I follow, and I added their feed there so
that I could follow them in Feedly instead of receiving emails in my inbox every week.<br>Every weekend I&rsquo;ll try to review my Feedly list and add the posts I like to read to my Instapaper.<br>It takes around 15-20 minutes to filter posts that the titles are interesting to me and add
them to Instapaper for reading them later.<br><strong>Tip:</strong> Don&rsquo;t add any news websites to your Feedly feed, they post a lot of articles
daily and can spam your feed.</p><h2 id=instapaper><a href=https://instapaper.com/>Instapaper</a></h2><p>I like Instapaper because of its simplicity and features like sending unread articles to Kindle.
I usually send unread posts in my Instapaper account to my Kindle(Instapaper merges multiple
posts in a single PDF file), or use its mobile app to read posts when I don&rsquo;t have access to my
Kindle.<br>After reading each article, I can tag and archive the ones that I like and delete other ones.</p><h2 id=obsidian><a href=https://obsidian.md/>Obsidian</a></h2><p>Obsidian is a great tool for note-taking and writing with a great offline experience and a
cool desktop app(with VIM mode support), I&rsquo;m new to Obsidian but I found that it has plugins
for Instapaper and Kindle that I can sync my notes on articles and books with Obsidian, which is great!</p></div></div><div class=footer><div class=footer-copy>Â© 2025 Peyman Salehi.</div><div class=footer-social><span class="social-icon social-icon-twitter"><a href=https://twitter.com/_peymanslh title=twitter target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/images/social/twitter.svg width=24 height=24 alt=twitter>
