I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer.
Most of my experiences are in back-end development. Besides that, I&amp;rsquo;m very enthusiastic about system engineering and spend my free time researching and learning more about it.
In my blog, I mostly write about what I learn or experience in my job, and it&amp;rsquo;s usually related to software engineering, programming languages, Linux, open-source software, and tools I use.
And finally, I&amp;rsquo;m working in tech to make things easier for ourselves, not doing weird stuff!</description></item></channel></rss>
