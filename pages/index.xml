I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer.&lt;br>
Most of my experiences are in back-end development.
Besides that, I&amp;rsquo;m very enthusiastic about system engineering and
spend my free time researching and learning more about it.&lt;br>
In my blog, I mostly write about what I learn or experience in my job,
and it&amp;rsquo;s usually related to software engineering, programming languages,
Linux, open-source software, and tools I use.&lt;br>
And finally, I&amp;rsquo;m working in tech to make things easier for ourselves,
not doing weird stuff!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
